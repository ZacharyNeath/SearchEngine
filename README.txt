Notes:
1. Run the mongo daemon with dbpath=database

2. The crawler runs in batches. If you want to run it, you'll have
to wait till the batch is done and then hit q to end or hit
anything else to continue.

3. The crawler does print out errors and warning but they
don't cause issue with the crawling

4. When you start the server, it will take about 20 seconds
to start due to the indexing
